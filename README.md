Calculates how many months you have left to pay your mortgage

I tried to find something easy online but I guess I didn't try hard enough so decided to write this quick and easy program.

**First:**

Edit the calculator.rb file with your monthly payment and current principal

**Then Run:**

`ruby calculator.rb`
